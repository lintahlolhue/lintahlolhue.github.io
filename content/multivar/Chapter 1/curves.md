  What is a curve/path and how do you parameterise it?

### Curves
ooh you sniff turkey fat. okay, what is a curve? well, it's a bunch of points that are connected together. more formally, it's

Definition 1. Curves

Let $\c{pink} \vec{r} : I \to \mbb{R}^n$ be a *continuous* vector valued function, where $\c{orange} I \subseteq \mbb{R}$ is an interval. Then, the set of points
$$\c{lime} \Large \mathcal{C} = \\{ \vec{r}(t) \mid t \in I \\}$$
is a curve. The function $\c{pink} \vec{r}$ is called a *parameterisation* of the curve.
{{</ box >}}
{{</ centr >}}
literally just a collection of points. all of your favourite functions are in there, like $\c{pink} y = x^2$ or $\c{orchid} y = e^x$ 
{{<tip >}}
{{<prob "easy">}}
Question for the initiated. How would you define $\c{pink} y = x^2$ or $\c{orchid} y = e^x$ as **vector functions**?

### Parameterisations

okay, let's talk parameterisations. what are they? well, they're just a way of representing a curve. for example, $\c{pink} \vec{r}(t) = \vecD{t}{t^2}$ is a parameterisation of $\c{pink} y = x^2$. 

{{< tip "warn" >}}
Parameterisations need not be unique! For example, $\c{pink} \vec{r}(t) = \vecD{t}{t^2}$ and $\c{pink} \vec{r}(t) = \vecD{t^2}{t^4}$ are both parameterisations of $\c{pink} y = x^2$.
{{</tip>}}

For a visual example, take $$\Large \c{red} \vec{r_1}(t) = \vecD{\cos(t)}{\sin(t)} \c{white} \tu{ and  } \\; \c{lime} \vec{r_2}(t) = \vecD{\cos(2t)}{\sin(2t)}$$

Notice how they both draw out the unit circle but at different speeds? That's because they're parameterisations of the same curve, but with different *speeds*.

### Problems
  

{{< prob "med" >}}
{{<tip "warn" >}} Do [Problem 4](../vfunc/#problems) of [Vector Functions](../vfunc) first. {{</tip>}}

1. Let $\c{orchid} \vec{r}(t)$ be a parameterisation of a curve $\c{lime} \mathcal{C} \in \mbb{R}^3$ such that $\c{pink} \vec{r}(0) = (R,-R,R)$, where $\c{pink} R > 0$.  

    Suppose $\c{pink} \vec{r}(t) \neq 0$ and $\c{lime} \vec{r}(t) \x \vec{r'}(t) = 0$ for all points on $\c{lime} \mathcal{C}$. Show that $\c{lime} \mathcal{C}$ lies on the surface of a sphere and determine the centre and radius of the sphere.

2. Consider the curve with equation
$$\Large \c{cyan}y = x^2$$
Find a parameterisation of this curve using a parameter $\c{pink} \mu$ such that $\c{pink} 0 < \mu < 1$

{{< toggle showText="Hint 1" hideText="Hide hint" >}}
What function do you know that is monotonically increasing (that just means it's always going up, like Smarmy's stocks) and has a range of $\c{lime} (-\infty,\infty)$?
{{< /toggle >}}
{{< toggle showText="Hint 2" hideText="Hide hint" >}}
The answer to the previous hint is $\c{orange} \tan(x)$. Now, how can you use this to parameterise the curve?

(maybe i draw an animation for this one too?)
