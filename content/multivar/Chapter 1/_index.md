  Vectors... and functions of vectors!

So, I'm not gonna go over a vector again, you've probably heard about it a {{< col "red" >}} million billion {{</ col >}} times, so I'll just explain what you have in store for you.

I'll have a linear algebra section soon that this will point to but for now

| Section      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Vector products      | Dot product {{< col "lime" >}} ($\x$) {{</ col >}} and **Cross** product {{< col "orange" >}} ($\times$) {{</ col >}}    |
| Vector functions and their $\c{pink} \Large \deriv{t}$   | $\c{cyan} \Large f(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t)\rangle$       |
| Unit tangent and unit normal vectors  | The vectors that lie tangent and perpendicular to a vector function $\color{pink} f$       |
| Curves and parameterisations  | A curve is exactly what you think it is. A parameterisation is just  a way of representing a curve!      |

{{< tip >}}
and ofc in standard {{< col "tan" >}}  Micky D {{</ col >}} fashion, there will be {{< col "violet" >}}  **example problems** {{</ col >}} at the *end* of every section as well as a few {{< col "violet" >}}  **exam problems** {{</ col >}} in the *last section* of this chapter.
