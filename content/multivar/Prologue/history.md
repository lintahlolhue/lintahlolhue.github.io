alright, so who's to blame for making you study this bloody subject?

You know it, isuck newton,

{{< tip "warning" >}}
They say Isaac Newton died a virgin. That means you, my dear reader, have something over one of the greatest geniuses of all time. 

<h3 style="display: inline;"> You're still alive. </h3> {{< kekwait >}}

### Calculus 

so anyway the story goes, a plague {{<col "orange" >}}(think covid-19){{</col>}} hits Cambridge in 1666 and Newton self quarantines, and in that time, develops the foundations of Calculus. 

what a fuckin stud.

anyway, it wasn't actually Sir Isaac Newton who came up with Calculus, it was {{<col "lime" >}} Pierre De Fermat {{</col>}} (the Fermat's Last Theorem guy) and 
 {{<col "cyan" >}} Rene Descartes {{</col>}} (I think, therefore I am) with their mystical 17th century voodoo techniques (they literally invented the limit definition of the `derivative` before it was cool)


### Where's the fookin 3D?

turns out that fucker Newton also experimented with partial derivatives, $\Large \color{pink} \f{\partial }{\partial x}$, as seen in his *Method of Fluxions*, an early calculus treatise.

 the real 3D shit came with {{<col "violet" >}}Leonhard Euler,{{</col>}}the most prolific mathematician in history (idk Erdos might have beat him).

 That's where we saw *integrating factors*, and that was followed by a more systematic treatment in the 18th century by mathematicians we don't really care about right now (sorry guys!)

 To put {{<col "brown" >}} shit {{</col>}} into perspective, most of the math you've learned in the past before Calculus was probably known to scholars around the beginning of the 1600s. Knowing Calculus I and II puts you at around the year 1700. With  {{<col "tan" >}} Multivariable Calculus {{</col>}} under your belt, you're probably at the turn of the 19th century. What a crazy jump.
