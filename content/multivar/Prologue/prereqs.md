  What do you need to know for Multivar?

### Vectors (and some matrices)
I mean, its just a bunch of fuckin numbers collected together, 
{{< centr >}}
$$\Large \color{pink} \vecD{2}{3}$$see?
{{< /centr >}}

*Some* familiarity with matrices will be needed, but really I recommend you understand what a matrix is doing behind the hood (cough cough linear transformations)

In any case, check out

# FIX THIS ON PHONE, STRETCHES SCREEN, MAKE WIDTH DYNAMIC

at the very least, it's an enjoyable watch

### Differentiation & Integration
This one should be rather bloody obvious, how can one do Calc III without II or I? {{< kekw >}} {{< tip "warning" >}}
Americunts call it {{< col color="cyan">}} Calc III
{{< /col >}} instead of {{< col color="magenta">}} Multivariable Calculus
{{< /col >}}

{{< /tip >}}

but fr you gotta know $$\Large \color{orange} \deriv{x} f(x) \tu{ and } \int f(x) \\; \tu{dx}$$

### Polar coordinates


this fuckin topic rears its ugly head pretty often, and serves as the foundation for topics such as Jacobian coordinate transformations. don't worry, ol' {{< col "tan" >}} Micky {{</ col >}} has the perfect cocktail for you.

but anyways, for review, its just (INSERT PHOTO HERE IN MANIM)
$$
\Large \begin{align*}
\c{pink} x = \c{red} r \c{pink} \cos(\theta) \\\ 
\c{pink} y = \c{red} r \c{pink} \sin(\theta)
\end{align*}
$$
where $\c{red} \Large r$ is the distance from our point to the origin and $\c{pink} \Large \theta$ is the angle our point makes with the horizontal, as seen in the pic.
