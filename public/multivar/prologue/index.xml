      <description>alright, so who&#39;s to blame for making you study this bloody subject?
You know it, isuck newton,
They say Isaac Newton died a virgin. That means you, my dear reader, have something over one of the greatest geniuses of all time.
You&#39;re still alive. Calculus so anyway the story goes, a plague (think covid-19) hits Cambridge in 1666 and Newton self quarantines, and in that time, develops the foundations of Calculus.</description>

Vectors (and some matrices) I mean, its just a bunch of fuckin numbers collected together, $$\Large \color{pink} \vecD{2}{3}$$see? Some familiarity with matrices will be needed, but really I recommend you understand what a matrix is doing behind the hood (cough cough linear transformations)
In any case, check out
at the very least, it&#39;s an enjoyable watch</description>
